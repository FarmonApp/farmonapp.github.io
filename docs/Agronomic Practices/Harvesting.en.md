# Harvesting

## Harvesting Techniques

Camelina requires low-speed combine settings to avoid seed loss. Swathing may be necessary if 75% of the pods have yellowed.

- **Combine Settings**: Operate at a low speed (3-4 km/h) and use a low airflow to avoid seed loss. Camelina seeds are lightweight, so careful adjustments of the fan are required.
- **Swathing**: Consider swathing when 75% of the pods have yellowed, approximately 2-3 weeks after flowering. Cut the plants about 20-25 cm above the ground for better aeration. Harvest 1 week after swathing, paying attention to weather conditions like wind and rain. But typically swathing is not required. 

## Maturity for Harvest

Camelina is ready for harvest when the pods turn from yellow to brown, and seeds separate easily from the pods with slight pressure.

- **Pod Maturity**: Camelina pods should transition from a yellow color to brown. At this point, the seeds will separate easily from the pods when pressed by hand.
- **Timeliness**: Avoid delaying harvest beyond 7-10 days after this stage to prevent seed loss and shattering. Monitor the field closely to ensure timely harvest.

## Swathing

Swath camelina when 75% of the pods have yellowed to avoid seed loss. Ensure swaths are well-ventilated and monitor weather conditions closely.

- **When to Swath**: When 75% of the camelina pods have turned yellow, the crop is ready to be swathed. This is approximately 2-3 weeks after flowering and the crop will have around 35% moisture.
- **Swathing Technique**: Cut the plants at 20-25 cm above the soil, just below the lowest pods. This encourages airflow and speeds up drying.
- **Post-Swathing**: Wait for about 1 week after swathing to harvest, but monitor closely for rain or strong winds, which could cause losses from shattering.


## Post-Harvest Cleaning and Drying

Clean and dry camelina seeds immediately after harvest to reduce moisture and impurities, ensuring safe storage and maintaining quality.


- **Cleaning**: If the harvest contains green plant material or high moisture levels, clean the seeds as soon as possibleâ€”preferably within 24 hours.
- **Drying**: Dry the seeds to less than 9% moisture to prevent spoilage. Seeds stored at higher moisture levels are prone to mold and deterioration. Drying should be done immediately if moisture exceeds 9%.

## Drying & Storage

Ensure harvested camelina seeds have less than 9% moisture content to avoid spoilage during storage. Clean and dry seeds promptly after harvest.

- **Moisture**: For safe long-term storage, seed moisture content should be below 9%. If necessary, dry seeds immediately after harvest.
- **Storage**: Store camelina in a well-ventilated, dry environment to prevent mold or spoilage. Seed cleaning should be done as soon as possible to reduce moisture levels and remove impurities.
