# Variety Selection

The selection of the right variety for the right situation is critcal for success. However, often seed availability can create a bottleneck for producers, espeically those looking for larger quantities.

## Winter Camelina

Winter camelina is more coimmonly available in North America where the colder climate and use as a cover crop has increased seed availablity of winter varieties. 

- **Varieties**: 
Bison, 2019, Univ. Minn., Standout winter variety for cold tolerance, 
Britanny, 2021, Sustainable Oils LLC, cold tolerant and high oil yield. 
Blackmore, 2022, Univ. Minn., 
Colden, 2016, Univ. Minn. and USDA ARS, Improved winter tolerance and seed yield. 
MT-14, 2014, Montana State Univ., Bred for extreme cold tolerance. 
HPX-WG4-1â€™ (WG4), Kansas State University and USDA ARS, bred for consistent yield and cold hardiness.



## Spring Camelina

Spring camelina is more commonly available in Europe due to its resurgence in use in southern Europe. 

- **Varieties**:
Omega, Sustainable Oils LLC, breed for high oil content and adpatability to a range of environments.
Midas, 2013, Montana State University, breed for high oil content and particularly high adaptability to dryland conditions.
Joelle, 2009, Breed for it high oil content and growing in a diversity of environments, can be planted as a spring type also.
Ligena, 1990's, Release from Europe as an older traditional variety.
Calena, 1990's release from Europe, as an older traditional variety.
Celine, Innovafeed, high adpatablity for different climates and oil production. 

## Breeding

There is much breeding work to be done on camelina. There are several common goals of breeding projects such as increased seed size, increased oil, oil quality, and shorter days to maturity. Public breeding and private breeding are both occuring. Some of the public breeding is geared towards better winter adaptability for cover crops mixes and adaptability to various climates. While private breeding projects tend to focus on oil productivity, oil content, shorter seasons, and larger seeds.
