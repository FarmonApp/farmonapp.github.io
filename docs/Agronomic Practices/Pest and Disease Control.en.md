# Pests and Disease Control

Camelina is highly resistant to pests and diseases. However, late-stage mildew can occur, though it typically doesnâ€™t affect yields.


 **Pests**: Camelina is rarely attacked by common pests such as flea beetles or seed weevils more common in rape or canola. .

- **Diseases**: Fungicide applications are usually unnecessary. However, if downy mildew occurs late in the season, it has been shown to have a large impact on yield.(LeClerc2021.) Fungicides like azoxystrobin may be used if mildew appears before the rosette stage. There are other diseases that can effect Camelina such as aster yellows, club root, and white rust, so be aware if these are common diseases in your region.
