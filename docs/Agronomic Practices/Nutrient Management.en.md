# Nutrient Management

Fertilization needs vary depending on the previous crop. After cereals, 40 kg/ha nitrogen is essential, while after peas, only 10 kg/ha may be needed or no fertilization at all.

- **After Cereals**: Apply 40 kg/ha nitrogen at sowing to support camelina’s growth and ensure it reaches its potential yield.
- **After Peas**: Fertilization is optional; 10 kg/ha of nitrogen is recommended for a quicker start, but the residual nitrogen from peas is usually sufficient for the crop’s development.
