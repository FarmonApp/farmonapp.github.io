# Parcel Selection

When planting camelina it is important to consider the crops and herbicide residue that have been used previously on the field. Likewise it is wise to consider the beneficial effects of the crop on the field for the proceeding crop. 

- **Previous Crops**: It is important to consider the potential weeds in the field from the previous crop of particular concern are grass species. 
- **Herbicide Awareness**: Pay attention to herbicide residues, especially ALS and PDS herbicides from previous crops, which can affect camelina growth in dry conditions. Some herbicides can persist in the soil, so consult local experts to verify if the land is safe for camelina.
- **Weed Control**: Choose parcels with minimal weed pressure, especially grasses. Ensure effective weed management before sowing, as camelina competes poorly with weeds in its early stages.
- **Proceeding crop**: The biofumigant effect of camelina can be used to increase yield in crops such as corn, sorghum, or other crops where control of soil fungus and bacteria can be helpful.
