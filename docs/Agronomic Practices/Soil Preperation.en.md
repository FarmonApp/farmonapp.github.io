# Soil Preparation

Direct sowing is preferred to conserve moisture, while shallow cultivation should only be done to maintain soil moisture. Over-cultivation should be avoided.

- **Direct Sowing**: Strongly recommended to preserve soil moisture, especially in dry conditions. Direct sowing reduces soil disturbance and helps maintain its structure.
- **Shallow Cultivation**: If required, limit to a maximum of 2-3 cm depth to prevent unnecessary moisture loss and maintain a favorable seedbed.
- **Moisture Conservation**: Camelina performs best when soil moisture is conserved. Avoid deep tillage that could deplete moisture reserves.
