# Planting Guidelines

Ideally, sow camelina within 24-48 hours of harvesting the previous crop, with a seeding rate of 8 kg/ha and a depth of 3 cm in direct sowing conditions.

## Seedbed Preperation

Ideal seedbed preperation will ensure better seed to soil contact for this shallowly seeded crop. However seeding into many seed beds has proven good crops due to its plasticity. 

## Direct Seeding rates

- **Seeding Rate**: 8 kg/ha is the recommended seeding rate, with row spacing between 12.5-15 cm.
- **Depth**: For direct sowing, aim for 3 cm depth, and 0.5-1 cm if shallow cultivation is used. Adjust depth based on soil moisture conditions and upcoming weather.

## Broadcast and Ariel Seeding rates

While not usually recommended Camelina can be broadcast and there are examples of aireal seeding by drone, though no recommended rates exist yet. Being a lightweight seed factors like height and wind need be considered for good coverage. Typical rates for broadcasting are around 12-15 kg/ha, though more research on this is needed.
