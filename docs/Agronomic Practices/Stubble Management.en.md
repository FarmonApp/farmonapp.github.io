# Stubble Management

Proper stubble management is crucial for camelina to ensure good seed-to-soil contact and to prevent nitrogen deficiency. Remove or manage barley straw effectively.

- **Preceding**: Itâ€™s crucial to remove straw from previous crops to avoid nitrogen competition and to ensure proper seed-to-soil contact.
- **Stubble Height**: For direct sowing, harvest the previous crop as high as possible, leaving the stubble standing.
- **Straw Management**: Evenly distribute light straw or chaff that may obstruct sowing. In the case of disk drilling, avoid it completely and opt for stubble plowing or shallow tillage.
