# Nutrient Management

Fertilization needs vary depending on the previous crop. After cereals, 40 kg/ha nitrogen is essential, while after peas, only 10 kg/ha may be needed or no fertilization at all.

- **After Cereals**: Apply 40 kg/ha nitrogen at sowing to support camelina’s growth and ensure it reaches its potential yield.
- **After Peas**: Fertilization is optional; 10 kg/ha of nitrogen is recommended for a quicker start, but the residual nitrogen from peas is usually sufficient for the crop’s development.


# Water Management

While camelina is drought-tolerant, it benefits from light irrigation at key stages, such as post-sowing, rosette stage, and flowering, to optimize yield.


- **Drought Tolerance**: Camelina can thrive with little water, but strategic irrigation boosts yields.

- **Irrigation Timing**:
    - **Post-Sowing**: Apply 10-20 mm to aid germination.
    - **Rosette Stage**: 20-25 mm to support early vegetative growth.
    - **Flowering**: 25-35 mm to maximize seed development.
