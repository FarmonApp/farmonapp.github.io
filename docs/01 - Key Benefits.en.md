# Key Benefits

## Agricultural and Environmental Benefits
Camelina provides multiple agricultural and environmental benefits, including drought tolerance, soil improvement, and support for biodiversity. Its strong resistance to pests and diseases reduces the need for chemical inputs.

- **Drought-Resistance**: Camelina requires less water compared to other oilseeds, making it ideal for regions with low rainfall or during dry seasons.
- **Soil Structuring**: The root system helps to improve soil structure and fertility, contributing to better water retention and aeration.
- **Nitrate Trap**: Acts as a natural nitrate trap, preventing nutrient loss and contributing to soil fertility.
- **Pest and Disease Resistance**: Camelina is highly resilient, minimizing the need for chemical pesticides and reducing environmental impact.
- **Pollinator Support**: Camelinaâ€™s flowers attract pollinators, enhancing local biodiversity and supporting ecosystem services.

## Intermediate Crop Benefits
Camelina can be used as an intermediate summer crop or a cover crop, offering flexibility in crop rotation while improving soil health and preventing erosion.

- **Flexible Use**: Can be grown as a main crop or a cover crop in rotation with cereals or legumes.
- **Soil Health**: If not harvested, it functions as a highly effective cover crop that prevents soil erosion, captures nitrates, and enhances soil structure.
- **Sustainable Farming**: Replaces fallow periods with a productive cover crop that improves the land for the next planting season.
- **Reduced Inputs**: Requires minimal inputs due to its low nutrient and water needs, making it economically even with slightly lower yields.
