# Camelina as a supplement

Camelina oil is a powerful addition to the food supplement market, offering unique health benefits, sustainability, and a high-growth opportunity, driven by consumer demand for natural, nutrient-rich supplements.

- Camelina oil is rich in omega-3, omega-6, and vitamin E, making it a potent natural supplement for improving cardiovascular health, reducing inflammation, and supporting immune function.
- Its cold-pressed extraction method preserves nutrients, making it an appealing choice for clean-label, organic, and natural supplement markets.
- Camelina is a low-input, sustainable crop, making the oil environmentally friendly, which aligns with growing consumer interest in eco-conscious and ethically produced supplements.
- The crop doesnâ€™t compete with food crops, addressing the food vs. fuel debate and supporting responsible agriculture practices.
- With the rising demand for plant-based, nutrient-dense supplements, camelina oil has significant market potential for rapid growth in the global health and wellness sector.
