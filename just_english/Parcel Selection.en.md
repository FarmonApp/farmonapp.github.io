# Parcel Selection

Camelina should be planted after winter cereals or peas on parcels that are free of weeds and herbicide residues, ensuring optimal growth and yield.

- **Previous Crops**: Ideally sown after winter cereals or peas that are harvested by July 10 for a mid-October harvest.
- **Herbicide Awareness**: Pay attention to herbicide residues, especially ALS and PDS herbicides from previous crops, which can affect camelina growth in dry conditions. Some herbicides can persist in the soil, so consult local experts to verify if the land is safe for camelina.
- **Weed Control**: Choose parcels with minimal weed pressure. Ensure effective weed management before sowing, as camelina competes poorly with weeds in its early stages.
