# Water Management

While camelina is drought-tolerant, it benefits from light irrigation at key stages, such as post-sowing, rosette stage, and flowering, to optimize yield.


- **Drought Tolerance**: Camelina can thrive with little water, but strategic irrigation boosts yields.
- **Irrigation Timing**:
    - **Post-Sowing**: Apply 10-20 mm to aid germination.
    - **Rosette Stage**: 20-25 mm to support early vegetative growth.
    - **Flowering**: 25-35 mm to maximize seed development.
