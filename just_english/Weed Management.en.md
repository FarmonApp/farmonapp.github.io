# Weed Management

Pre-sowing weed control is critical, especially for perennial grasses. Post-emergence, camelina competes well with weeds if well-established.

- **Pre-Sowing**: Ensure fields are clear of weeds. Use total herbicides if needed before sowing to minimize weed competition.
- **Post-Emergence**: In cases of strong grass weed regrowth, use approved herbicides such as fluazifop-p-butyl or clethodim. Apply any necessary herbicides before the stem elongation stage to avoid yield losses.
