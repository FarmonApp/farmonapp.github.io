# Planting Guidelines

Ideally, sow camelina within 24-48 hours of harvesting the previous crop, with a seeding rate of 8 kg/ha and a depth of 3 cm in direct sowing conditions.

- **Seeding Rate**: 8 kg/ha is the recommended seeding rate, with row spacing between 12.5-15 cm.
- **Depth**: For direct sowing, aim for 3 cm depth, and 0.5-1 cm if shallow cultivation is used. Adjust depth based on soil moisture conditions and upcoming weather.
