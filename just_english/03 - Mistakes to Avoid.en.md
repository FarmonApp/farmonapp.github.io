# Mistakes to Avoid

- **Inadequate Fertilization**: Under-fertilization, especially after cereal crops, will limit camelinaâ€™s potential. Make sure to apply nitrogen as required to support early growth.
- **Poor Weed Control**: Failing to control weeds before sowing can lead to competition and reduced yields. Ensure fields are clear of grasses and broadleaf weeds before planting.
- **Deep Tillage**: Over-cultivating the soil can deplete moisture and disturb soil structure. Stick to shallow tillage or direct sowing to preserve soil health and moisture levels.
